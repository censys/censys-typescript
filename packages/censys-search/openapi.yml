  description:
    "The Censys REST API provides programmatic access to the same data accessible through the web
    interface. API access is governed by our [Terms of Service](https://censys.io/tos/) and all scripted access should use this API.
    Endpoints are hosted at [`https://search.censys.io`](https://search.censys.io) and require authenticating with HTTP basic auth using
    the API ID and secret that are shown on the [account](/account/api) page, which also lists the rate limits that apply to your account.
    \n\n### Use This API
    \n - Import the Censys [Postman Collection](https://github.com/censys/censys-postman) and call the API with Postman.
    \n - Call the API from your Python app using our [Python library](https://github.com/censys/censys-python).
    \n - Call the API from your NodeJS app using our [NodeJS library](https://github.com/censys/censys-node-js).

        \n\n**Cursor Pagination**
        \n\nSearch endpoints rely on using cursors for efficient pagination.
        \n\nEach search result may return a `next` and `prev` cursor value
        which can be used to fetch additional pages of results.
        \n\n```json
        \n{\n\t\"links\":{
        \n\t\t\"prev\":\"prevCursorToken\",
        \n\t\t\"next\":\"nextCursorToken\"
        \n\t},
        \n\t[Rest of Response]\n}
        \n```
        \nThe returned cursor token values can be added to the search endpoint as
        a `cursor` parameter to fetch either the next page of results or the previous page.
        \n\nThe entire set of results can be iterated page-by-page using returned
        cursors. If no cursor is given, the first page will be returned."

        Fetches a list of events for the host with the specified IP address.

        **Cursor Pagination**

        This endpoint relies on using cursors for efficient pagination. Each result may
        return a `next` cursor value which can be used to fetch additional pages of results.
        This endpoint only support forward-pagination.

        ```json
        {
          "links": {
            "next": "nextCursorToken"
          },
          [Rest of Response]
        }
        ```
        The returned cursor token values can be added to the endpoint as a `cursor`
        parameter to fetch the next page of results.
        The entire set of results can be iterated page-by-page using returned
        cursors. If no cursor is given, the first page will be returned.

        **Cursor Pagination**
        \n\n
        Search endpoints rely on using cursors for efficient pagination.
        \n\n
        Each search result may return a `next` and `prev` cursor value
        which can be used to fetch additional pages of results.
        \n\n
        ```json
          \n{\n\t\"links\":{
          \n\t\t\"prev\":\"prevCursorToken\",
          \n\t\t\"next\":\"nextCursorToken\"
          \n\t},
          \n\t[Rest of Response]\n}
          \n
        ```
        \n
        The returned cursor token values can be added to the search endpoint as
        a `cursor` parameter to fetch either the next page of results or the previous page.
        \n\n
        The entire set of results can be iterated page-by-page using returned
        cursors. If no cursor is given, the first page will be returned."

        **Cursor Pagination**
        \n\n
        Search endpoints rely on using cursors for efficient pagination.
        \n\n
        Each search result may return a `next` and `prev` cursor value
        which can be used to fetch additional pages of results.
        \n\n
        ```json
          \n{\n\t\"links\":{
          \n\t\t\"prev\":\"prevCursorToken\",
          \n\t\t\"next\":\"nextCursorToken\"
          \n\t},
          \n\t[Rest of Response]\n}
          \n
        ```
        \n
        The returned cursor token values can be added to the search endpoint as
        a `cursor` parameter to fetch either the next page of results or the previous page.
        \n\n
        The entire set of results can be iterated page-by-page using returned
        cursors. If no cursor is given, the first page will be returned."

        **Cursor Pagination**

        This endpoint relies on using cursors for efficient pagination. Each result may
        return a `next` cursor value which can be used to fetch additional pages of results.
        This endpoint only support forward-pagination.

        ```json
        {
          "links": {
            "next": "nextCursorToken"
          },
          [Rest of Response]
        }
        ```
        The returned cursor token values can be added to the endpoint as a `cursor`
        parameter to fetch the next page of results.
        The entire set of results can be iterated page-by-page using returned
        cursors. If no cursor is given, the first page will be returned.
